# Machine-Learning-Assignment
Contains my ML assignments and their solution by me.

Assingment 1 : Implemented Linear regression for CO2 emissions prediction using the CO2 Emission dataset.
Utilized various data Visualization techniques.Used TSNE dimensionality reduction and PCA, then data encoding and regularization techniques, followed by SGDRegressor

Assingment 4 : Implemented unsupervised learning.Used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature selection and K-means clustering for grouping inputs based on features obtained after PCA. Theoretical questions are based on CNN (Convolutional neural network).
